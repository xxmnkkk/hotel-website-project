                <div class="customer-feedbacks">The hotel is new and with all the amenities except a pool. The rooms are
                    ample and comfortable. They
                    offer complementary fruit, chocolates and coffee in the room. The view is very good. You have a 5
                    minute walk to the Mall. It is hilly, but you are in the mountains... . Breakfast is good and you
                    can choose: Indian, continental, etc. Also the restaurant is very good and reasonably priced.
                    Good service. Having stayed on the 5 stars several times, this is a very good option and mostly
                    convenient for a business trip.

                </div>
                <div class="customer-feedbacks">we spent 3 glorious days there just before Diwali. Very polite staff ,
                    smart hotel , good decor,
                    almost on the Mall Road but at one end away from the buzz. Pleasant walk from the centre. Good food,
                    excellent spa ! What more .....</div>
            </div>
            <div class="customer-inner-div">
                <div class="customer-feedbacks">Marina is a nice hotel with excellent food and service. It is located
                    approximately 1 km from the
                    LIFT and you have to walk uphill from Marina to the market/ Lift on Mall Road. Therefore, with kids
                    or elderly people, it would be a bit difficult to walk that distance and that too uphill.</div>
                <div class="customer-feedbacks">Arrived today full of expectations having booked based on tripadvisor
                    reports.
                    Firstly it is not close to The Mall but a taxi ride away.
                    The room we were given was ok but when we had a shower the bathroom the room flooded, the reception
                    sent down a porter to mop it up but we wanted moving (at Â£95 a night i expect better).</div>
                <div class="customer-feedbacks">We travelled to Shimla in December 2014 and stayed at the Marina hotel
                    for 2 nights. The property
                    is 5 minutes walking distance from the mall road and very close to the Chief Ministers bunglow.
                    Rooms on the 3rd floor have a lovely view of the valley and the town nestled on the hillocks. As is
                    common in Shimla, the reception is on the top floor and you decend down to the lower floors as the
                    property is built on slopes.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="customer-inner-div">
                <div class="customer-feedbacks">Hotel Marina is a very nice luxury hotel that suited our requirements in
                    Shimla. Rather it was the
                    only premium luxury hotel i found in Shimla. The staff is very courteous, warm and friendly esp.
                    Arvantika and Neeraj. Room decor is very good and all its facilities including bed, raindance
                    shower, balcony etc. are very good. Surprisingly, I found their Mini-bar empty - I would strongly
                    recommend them to fill it as per the hotel standards. Also if they can provide shaving mirror in the
                    bathroom then it will be good. Spread of choices in the breakfast menu was very good; it will be
                    good if they can provide water on the table and also add Muesli besides corn flakes.

                    Overall, it was an excellent experience staying at this hotel and I will surely go back to Marina
                    whenever I visit Shimla. Strongly recommended for everyone who is looking for a true luxury
                    experience.</div>
